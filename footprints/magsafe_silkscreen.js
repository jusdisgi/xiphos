// Stolen from larssont, then extended by jusdisgi.
//
// Draws the MagSafe ring two ways:
//   1. A hatched B.SilkS ring as a visual cue (original behaviour).
//   2. (optional, on by default) a REAL copper keepout / rule-area annulus on
//      the magnet-side copper layer, so the back-milled magnet pocket stays
//      clear of copper and the pour/traces/vias know to avoid it.
//
// Notes for a back-milled (blind) pocket on a 2-layer board:
//   - The keepout sits on the magnet side only (default B.Cu). That clears the
//     back GND pour, tracks, and through-vias from the milled band (a via would
//     be sheared by the pocket). It deliberately does NOT touch the front layer,
//     so the front GND pour stays continuous across the ring and the keys inside
//     the ring hole still reach GND. The GND vias of the keys inside the ring
//     hole stitch the centre island to the front plane; keys sitting ON the band
//     must drop their GND vias just off the band (vias are disallowed in it).
//   - keepout_margin grows the copper-clear band past the magnets so the pour
//     doesn't sit right on the ring / pocket wall. Silk stays at true diameters.
//   - pads are left allowed (the switches that sit over the band are front-side).
